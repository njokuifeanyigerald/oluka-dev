              <p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to the Department of Networking & System Security!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It is my honour today to answer some of your pressing questions like, Who is a Network Security Engineer, What are my chances of getting employed after the course and so on.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Network security engineers are responsible for the provisioning, deployment, configuration, and administration of many different pieces of network and security-related hardware and software. These include firewalls, routers, switches, various network-monitoring tools, and virtual private networks (VPNs). These engineers are a companyâ€™s first line of defense against unauthorized access from outside sources and potential security threats. Not only does a network security engineer know how to mitigate any potential threats that become evident, but they also how to strategize and prepare before any security threat is enacted.
              <br>Here at OIT, at the successful completion of our course, you will be able to:</p>
              <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>* Planning, engineering, and monitoring the security arrangements for the protection of the network systems.</li>
                <li>* Identifying, monitoring, and defining the requirements of the overall security of the system.</li>
                <li>* Creating different ways to solve the existing threats and security issues.</li>
                <li>* Configuring and implementing intrusion detection systems and firewalls.</li>
                <li>* Testing and checking the system for weaknesses in software and hardware.</li>
                <li>* Maintaining firewalls, virtual private networks, web protocols, and email security.</li>
                <li>* Configuring and installing security infrastructure devices.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
